<p><ul><li>Shrink Films</li><li>Stretch Films</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transparent overwrap films are crucial packaging materials that provide protection and visibility for products. The market primarily consists of two types: shrink films and stretch films. Shrink films contract tightly around the product when heat is applied, offering a secure, tamper-evident seal ideal for retail items.
