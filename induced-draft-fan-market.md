<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Induced Draft Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial</li><li>Radial</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Induced draft fans are crucial in managing airflow in various industrial processes. The market is segmented into three main types: axial, radial, and centrifugal fans. Axial fans move air parallel to the fan's axis, ideal for applications requiring high flow with lower pressure. Radial fans operate by directing air perpendicular to the axis, providing higher pressure with moderate flow. Centrifugal fans utilize a rotating impeller to increase air pressure and flow, making them suitable for high-resistance systems. Each type serves specific operational needs across industries.</p></p>
