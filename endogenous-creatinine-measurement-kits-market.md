<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endogenous Creatinine Measurement Kits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Jaffe's Kinetic Method</li><li>Enzymatic Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Endogenous Creatinine Measurement Kits market is primarily divided into two types: the Jaffe's Kinetic Method and the Enzymatic Method. The Jaffe's Kinetic Method is based on the reaction of creatinine with alkaline picrate to form a colored complex, allowing for quantification through absorbance measurements. In contrast, the Enzymatic Method employs specific enzymes to catalyze the conversion of creatinine, producing measurable byproducts, which enhances specificity and sensitivity. Both methods are vital for assessing kidney function and overall health.</p></p>
