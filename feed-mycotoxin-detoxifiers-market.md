<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Feed Mycotoxin Detoxifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mycotoxin Binders</li><li>Mycotoxin Modifiers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Feed Mycotoxin Detoxifiers market encompasses two primary types: mycotoxin binders and mycotoxin modifiers. Mycotoxin binders are substances that physically adsorb mycotoxins in animal feed, preventing their absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. They help to reduce the toxic effects on livestock. Mycotoxin modifiers, on the other hand, transform mycotoxins into less harmful compounds through biochemical interactions. Both types play a crucial role in enhancing animal health and performance by mitigating the adverse impacts of mycotoxin contamination.</p></p>
